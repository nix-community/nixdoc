## Version 3.0.1

### New Features

- **Official Doc-Comments Support:** We've introduced support for official doc-comments as defined in [RFC145](https://github.com/NixOS/rfcs/pull/145). This enhancement aligns nixdoc with our latest documentation standard.

### Deprecated Features

- **Legacy Custom Format:** The custom nixdoc format is now considered a legacy feature. We plan to phase it out in future versions to streamline documentation practices.
- We encourage users to transition to the official doc-comment format introduced in this release.
- For now we will continue to maintain the legacy format, but will not accept new features or enhancements for it. This decision allows for a period of transition to the new documentation practices.

See [Migration guide](./doc/migration.md) for smooth transition

## Version 3.0.0

Removed due to invalid lock file.

## 2.7.0

- Added support to customise the attribute set prefix, which was previously hardcoded to `lib`.
  The default is still `lib`, but you can pass `--prefix` now to use something else like `utils`.

## 2.6.0

- After doing a great job of maintaining the project for this year, @asymmetric is passing on the torch to @infinisil!
- Multi-line comments at the top of the file now become the section description text.
  By @phaer in https://github.com/nix-community/nixdoc/pull/70

  For example, the following file
  ```nix
  /*
  This is just a test!
  */
  {
    /* Increments a number by one */
    increment = x: x + 1;
  }
  ```

  turns into the following markdown:

  ```markdown
  # Test {#sec-functions-library-test}
  This is just a test!

  ## `lib.test.increment` {#function-library-lib.test.increment}

  Increments a number by one

  `x`

  : Function argument
  ```

  whereas before, the top section would've been empty.
